        Hospitals are usually <a class="mw-redirect" 
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_healthcare" 
            title="Publicly funded healthcare">funded by the public sector</a>, by

            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organisation" 
            title="Charitable organisation">charities</a>, including direct charitable 
        donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by
        <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_orders" 
            title="Religious orders">religious orders</a> or charitable individuals and

        Today, hospitals are largely staffed by professional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician" title="Physician">physicians</a>,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon" title="Surgeon">surgeons</a>, and
        <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse" title="Nurse">
        nurses</a>, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the founding 
        religious orders or by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering" 
            title="Volunteering">volunteers</a>. However, there are various Catholic 
        religious orders, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexians" 
            title="Alexians">Alexians</a> and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Secours_Sisters" 
            title="Bon Secours Sisters">Bon Secours Sisters</a>, which still focus on 
        hospital ministry today, as well as several Christian denominations, including 
        the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.<sup id="cite_ref-2"

        In accord with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally 
        &quot;places of hospitality&quot;, and this meaning is still preserved in the names of 
        some institutions such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hospital_Chelsea" 
            title="Royal Hospital Chelsea">Royal Hospital Chelsea</a>, established in 
        1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.</p>
